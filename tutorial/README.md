# Sirepo tutorial


## Getting started
### The Source panel
if you don't know, ask your accelerator group!

For convenience, here are some formulas that can be useful:


### The Beamline panel
advice: use pen an paper to figure out the proper disances

#### Initial wavefront
Very important (often overlooked)
#### Optical elements 

## How to get machine paramaters?
### Resonance 
### Harmonics
### Power density

## How to pick optical parameters
### Grating monochomator angle


### beamlines basics
+ resonance
+ numerical aperture

## Advanced topics
+ aberrations
+ partial coherence
+ energy spread

## Tips & Tricks
+ improve resolution

## Common mistakes
The grid size is sort if hidden

## Troubleshooting
A common mistake is to have things clipped somewhere (mirrors to small, or bad initial grid.)

In the case of a VLS, the numbers can be off

You don't have the right K-value

## Exporting data
To get quantitative data, you need to do the integral of the power density, or determine the full-width half-max

## Working examples
Simple beamline
